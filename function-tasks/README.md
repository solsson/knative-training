# Examples of Knative runtime tasks

The purpose of a runtime is to wrap a "function",
and indeed define what a function is in terms of code structure,
into something that runs in Knative.

This folder collects some runtime examples as build-pipeleine [Task](https://github.com/knative/build-pipeline/blob/master/docs/Concepts.md#task)s.
Tasks can be reused in pipelines to implement Source-to-URL workflows.
